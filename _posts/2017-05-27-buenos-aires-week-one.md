# Beginning to Live in Buenos Aires

Buenos Aires is a paradox of opposites. Fast & slow. Warm & cold. Friendly & callous. The days are as exhausting as they are exciting.

People move along the streets and subway at a steady clip. Maneuvering dense crowds is essentially an all-out rugby game.  Jabbing elbows into ribcages and stomping on feet are perfectly acceptable techniques for acquiring and defending your space.
 
Yet the people are unexpectedly relaxed about sharing a few minutes of their time in conversation or assistance. Strangers have stopped to offer aid Sammy and me more than just a few times: directions because we look lost or translations from a concerned eavesdropper. It's odd to think that these same people immediately re-enter the crowded fray.
 
The times that we do pull off a convincing amount of Spanish, though, people will very warmly stop what they are doing to share a few words. These conversations are very rewarding, especially when we manage to comprehend and communicate with some savvy. It's not always so smooth though: we run into a perfectly fluent English response to our Spanish inquiries at least daily. Those conversations are rarely as warm but still quite polite.  The caliber of English and education here is clearly quite high.
 
The weather is almost as inexplicable as the people. In our first week we've experienced  a pretty varied mix of pleasant to unpleasant days. Some of the days are quite warm, even balmy. Others have been crisply cool. Still others have mixed rain with sunshine.

We've managed to score three Spanish lessons, a tango class, and a magnificent apartment for the month.  Another set of classes are on the schedule for the next week and we're hoping to double down on the tango lifestyle.  It's very interesting to live here.  Looking forward to ending the days with a little more energy but super excited about the experiences we're having.
