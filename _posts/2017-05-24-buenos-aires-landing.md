# Landed in Buenos Aires

We just got to our apartment in Buenos Aires today. It's beautiful!

It's a hip little studio on the 9th floor of a modern apartment building.

It's in a very trendy area called Palermo Soho, which is where almost all of the good restaurants/bars/shopping are.
We're right in the center of things and it's very walkable, which I'm happy about!

We are feeling a little overwhelmed because we committed to stay here for a whole month--but it makes sense with our goals of really wanting to take Spanish lessons on the regular and familiarize ourselves with the culture.
I'm really excited what's in store for us this next month.
