# Patagonia

Patagonia was incredible!!! 

It really was one of the most beautiful places I have ever laid eyes on.

I remember seeing some National Geographic photos of Torres del Paine on instagram and I was so intrigued by how beautiful it was...and decided that I needed to go there someday! It was just as beautiful and amazing as the pictures that I initially saw.

It was cold (around 30-40F), but once we started walking we warmed up very quickly. We hiked anywhere from 10-20K daily (with our backpacks and hills this usually took between 4-8 hours per day), and we would spend the nights in "Refugios", which are basically hostels with meals. It was perfect! I felt so alive there.

El Chalten was our next stop in Patagonia. It's a tiny mountain town, with very colorful houses made of corrugated iron. We did 2 great day hikes from the town (one was 20k, the other 8k because of the poor weather the second day).

The town looks like it is rapidly being built up--there were half built houses and hotels on every block. I wouldn't be surprised if it doubles in size over the next few years. 

In general, Patagonia was hard to get to--took us 3 plane rides and a 5 hour bus ride, but I guess it makes sense since it's close to Antarctica! Despite that, I would still definitely recommend it :-)
