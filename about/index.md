# Como Se Lammy

Hi!  We are Liam and Sammy. 

## We Love to Travel

In May of 2017, we quit our respective jobs to travel through Latin America.

This blog is dedicated to documenting our travels.

## What's with the title?

It's a Spanish phrase that literally means, "How do you say L(iam + S)ammy?"
